Placebo
A ClamAV Central Management Toolkit for Enterprises

NOTICE: THIS IS JUST A PROVE OF CONCET! PLACEBO IS FAR AWAY FROM BEING STABLE OR SECURE!
ATM I'M WORKING ON A REWRITE WITH ABSOLUTLY NEW CODE. BUT I CAN'T SAY FOR SURE IF I WILL FINISH IT!

--- Introduction ---
This Project is Python, PHP, Bash and MySQL based.
It's supposed to be as simple as possible and must be really reliable. 

This Project is about creating a Interface for an admin, who has to manage a lot of linux nodes,
which all need a AntiVirus Scanner and has to be kept up to date.

Placebo provides:
	- A PHP based frontend
	- 2 listening Daemons (for the Client and the Server)
	- 2 Programms zu request data from the listening Daemons
	- A MySQL Database Backend
	- Full GPG-Key encrypted Communication between the Client and the Server


--- Functionality ---
	- Scan a host remotely 
	- Update a hosts Virus-Signarutes
	- Add a new host to DB
	- Get/Set client configuration parameters
	- Check client connectivitie
	
	|--> All results are saved to the MySQL DB and are available and controlable from the PHP-Frontend!
